# ipchecker
Batch "program" to check the IP address and let you know when it changes.

Just run put the batch file on your computer (in your path would be a good idea) and call it with the FQDN to check like:

ipchecker.bat google.com

It will get the address, then continue flushing your IP Cache and checking the address to see if it changes.

WHY do we need this?

Have you ever changed a DNS address and wanted to see when it was flushed through so you can validate your website is working? Well here you go!
